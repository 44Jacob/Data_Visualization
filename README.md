# Data_Visualization
Module 5 
In this assignment, "Data Visualization Module 5: Pymaceuticals Starter,
" it has been covered  several key concepts and skills related to data analysis and visualization in Python, focusing on the pharmaceutical industry. Here's a summary of what I learned:

Data Preparation and Cleaning:

How to load data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
Techniques for inspecting and cleaning the data to ensure its quality and readiness for analysis. This includes handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
Data Merging and Grouping:

Combining data from multiple sources using Pandas' merge and concat functions to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
Grouping data using groupby to perform aggregated analyses, such as calculating means, medians, and other statistical measures across different categories or treatment regimens.
Statistical Analysis:

Applying statistical methods to analyze the data, including calculating measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation).
Understanding and applying the Interquartile Range (IQR) to identify potential outliers in the data.
Calculating correlation coefficients to explore relationships between variables, such as mouse weight and tumor volume.
Data Visualization:

Creating various types of plots using Matplotlib and Pandas visualization capabilities, including:
Bar plots to compare the number of data points across treatment regimens.
Pie charts to visualize the distribution of categorical data, like the gender of mice.
Line plots to track changes in tumor volume over time for individual mice.
Scatter plots to explore the relationship between quantitative variables, such as mouse weight and average tumor volume.
Adding linear regression lines to scatter plots to assess the relationship between variables more formally.
Git and GitHub for Version Control:

Using Git for version control to manage changes to the project's codebase.
Cloning repositories from GitHub to work locally on your computer.
Committing changes to Git and pushing updates back to GitHub to maintain an up-to-date online version of the project.
Troubleshooting and Problem-Solving:

Diagnosing and fixing common issues encountered during data analysis and visualization, such as errors in code, issues with data formats, and dealing with unexpected results or findings.
This assignment provided hands-on experience with real-world data analysis and visualization tasks, emphasizing the importance of a systematic approach to data science projects, from initial data cleaning to advanced analysis and insightful visualizations.
